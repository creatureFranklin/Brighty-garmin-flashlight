# Brighty – The last flashlight app you’ll ever need

**Brighty** is a lightweight and reliable flashlight application for your Garmin watch.  
It turns your screen into a powerful light source – especially useful for devices without a built-in LED flashlight.  
Simple, intuitive, and always ready on your wrist.

## ⚙️ Settings

Brighty can be configured both in the **Garmin Connect IQ** settings (on your phone) and through the in-app **Settings** menu on the watch.  
Both control the same core options.

### Colors

Choose which colors are available in the flashlight:

-   White (default, always available)
-   Green
-   Red
-   Orange
-   Yellow

You can select **one or multiple colors**.  
When more than one color is enabled, you can **cycle through them directly in the app** using the watch buttons/touchscreen.

Internally, Brighty also optimizes the order of colors (e.g. extra shades of white on capable devices) so that the most useful options are easy to reach.

### Auto-Off timer

Define how long the flashlight should stay on before it turns off automatically:

-   **Never** (0 s) – flashlight stays on until you exit the app
-   **10 s**
-   **30 s**
-   **60 s**
-   **120 s**

This helps protect your battery and prevents accidentally leaving the flashlight on.

### Button hints

Toggle **on-screen hints** that show which button does what inside Brighty.

-   **On** – helpful when you are new to the app or to a specific device
-   **Off** – cleaner look once you know the controls

### Backlight behavior

Control how Brighty works with the watch backlight:

-   **Allow backlight**

    -   When enabled, Brighty is allowed to use the watch backlight together with the screen color for maximum visibility.
    -   When disabled, Brighty won’t try to control the backlight and will rely mainly on the screen itself (useful if you want to save battery or keep the watch more discreet).

-   **Backlight keep-alive**
    -   When enabled, Brighty **keeps the display lit at 100% brightness for the entire time you use the app** (until you exit it or the auto-off timer turns it off).
    -   This gives you the brightest and most stable light output, at the cost of higher battery usage.

These two options let you balance **brightness vs. battery life** depending on your needs.

### Flashing lights (SOS)

From the **Settings** menu on the watch you can also access:

-   **Flashing lights → SOS** – starts a dedicated view with a blinking light pattern in **SOS Morse code**.

This is meant for emergency signaling or for situations where you need to attract attention.

## 📚 How to Use

1. Install **Brighty** from the **Connect IQ Store**.
2. Open the app from your watch **Apps** menu.
3. Use the buttons or touchscreen to switch between colors (and SOS mode, if enabled).
4. Exit the app or let the **auto-off timer** handle battery saving.

Brighty – the last flashlight app you’ll ever need.

## 🧩 Device Notes

-   On some **8-color displays** (e.g. Forerunner 55) the “white” color may appear slightly yellow due to hardware limitations.
-   Brighty is primarily designed for watches **without a physical LED**, but it also works on devices that have one.
